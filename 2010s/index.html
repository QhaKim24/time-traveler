      <div class="title-bar">1990s: BBS & Phone Phreaking</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In the early 1990s, hacking was often initiated through dial-up modems and the notorious technique known as war dialing, where hackers would dial a range of phone numbers to find unprotected systems. Hackers explored Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), where they traded pirated software, games, and tools. These BBS systems became early gathering grounds for hackers and hackers’ communities. They also used blue boxes to bypass phone companies' long-distance systems, which allowed them to make free calls and hack into telecommunications networks.</p>
        <p>As these activities gained traction, underground hacker groups like the Legion of Doom and Masters of Deception formed, leading to rivalries and conflicts. These groups were involved in some of the most notorious cyber incidents in history, and some hackers even published underground zines—DIY publications—that chronicled their hacking activities. This era was foundational in shaping the hacker ethos, leading to a new world of digital subculture that played a major role in the rise of the internet.</p>

      <div class="title-bar">2000s: Hacktivism</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>During the 2000s, a new form of hacking, termed 'hacktivism', emerged as political movements began to use hacking as a tool for activism. Hacktivism combined the power of digital technologies with social and political goals. Groups like Anonymous and LulzSec used their technical skills to challenge and protest against political, corporate, and governmental powers. These groups carried out Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, defaced websites, and exposed sensitive information as acts of civil disobedience and resistance.</p>
        <p>Hacktivism became a prominent part of the internet age, particularly as a vehicle for protest against what were perceived as injustices or inequalities in society. The era of hacktivism saw major global incidents, such as the attacks on government and corporate sites following the Occupy Wall Street protests, and Anonymous' retaliation against various governments and corporations involved in controversial issues. The development of the internet, and the ease with which global activists could communicate and organize digitally, played a major role in transforming hacktivism into a defining movement.</p>

      <div class="title-bar">LulzSec & Mayhem</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>LulzSec was a small but highly disruptive hacking collective known for its chaotic and humorous cyberattacks. Formed in 2011, the group became infamous for launching a series of high-profile hacks, targeting organizations like Sony, PBS, and the CIA. Their goal was not just to expose vulnerabilities, but to ridicule their targets and challenge authority with a mix of anarchic humor and public defiance.</p>
        <p>LulzSec operated for a brief but intense period, claiming responsibility for disrupting high-profile websites and leaking personal information. Their attacks often included defacing websites, launching DDoS attacks, and releasing stolen data, which left many of their victims struggling to contain the damage. Despite the relatively short-lived nature of the group, their actions left an indelible mark on the hacking community and highlighted the potential for disruptive cyberattacks to cause real-world damage to corporations and government institutions alike.</p>

      <div class="title-bar">Operation Aurora</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Operation Aurora was a massive cyber-espionage campaign launched in late 2009, allegedly originating from China. The attack targeted several prominent American companies, including Google, Adobe, and other technology firms. It was one of the first known instances of a state-sponsored cyberattack, designed to steal intellectual property and sensitive corporate data.</p>
        <p>The attack exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Internet Explorer and was sophisticated enough to infiltrate some of the most secure corporate networks. The campaign exposed major security flaws in some of the largest global companies, revealing how vulnerable even the most advanced systems were to well-organized cyber threats. It also sparked a broader conversation about the role of state actors in cyberattacks and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information.</p>

      <div class="title-bar">Anonymous</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Anonymous is a decentralized collective of hackers and activists that gained widespread attention in the 2010s for its cyberattacks and online activism. The group, which originated on the 4chan online forum, is famous for its efforts to expose corruption and promote freedom of information. Anonymous became especially well-known for its operations targeting the Church of Scientology, as well as for its support of the Occupy Wall Street movement.</p>
        <p>The group's members, who remain anonymous by nature, have taken part in a wide range of cyberattacks, including DDoS attacks, hacking sensitive data, and leaking confidential information. The rise of Anonymous highlighted how loosely organized, global cyber-activist movements could use the internet as a powerful tool for political protest. The group has since evolved, continuing to act on political issues, and more recently, they have made headlines for launching cyberattacks against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

      <div class="title-bar">Target Breach</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In late 2013, Target, one of the largest retail giants in the United States, suffered one of the most infamous data breaches in history. The breach exposed personal and financial information of over 40 million customers, including names, credit card details, and email addresses. The breach was the result of a sophisticated cyberattack that exploited vulnerabilities in Target's security systems, which ultimately led to severe reputational and financial damage for the company.</p>
        <p>The Target breach was a wake-up call for many large companies regarding the importance of cybersecurity. It demonstrated the potential for cybercriminals to penetrate large corporations' systems, steal sensitive data, and cause lasting damage to their reputation and consumer trust. The breach also led to an increased focus on improving security practices, enhancing data protection regulations, and ensuring that retailers and other companies prioritize cybersecurity to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

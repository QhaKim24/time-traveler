      <div class="content">
        <p>In the early 1990s, hacking often began with dial-up modems and war dialing. Hackers explored Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), traded warez, and accessed underground networks using blue boxes. Kevin Mitnick's story gained national attention when he used social engineering and phone phreaking techniques to access corporate and government systems without authorization.</p>
        <p>These early hackers were often curious minds experimenting with systems—before hacking laws were widely enforced. Groups like the Legion of Doom and Masters of Deception formed rivalries, while others created underground zines and shared guides on system vulnerabilities and social engineering.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>During the 2000s, a new form of hacking called "hacktivism" gained momentum. Groups like Anonymous and LulzSec emerged to protest political and corporate power. Their tools included distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, doxing, and website defacements.</p>
        <p>Anonymous adopted the Guy Fawkes mask as a symbol of digital rebellion. Their actions blurred the line between criminal activity and political protest. Hacktivism became a defining part of the internet age, using code and networks as tools of resistance.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>LulzSec was a small but highly disruptive hacking collective known for its chaotic and humorous cyberattacks. They breached systems not for money or politics, but “for the lulz.” Their high-profile hacks included attacks on Sony, PBS, and the U.S. Senate.</p>
        <p>They exposed personal data, ridiculed targets, and challenged authority. While their reign only lasted 50 days, their impact was substantial. LulzSec became a symbol of cyber-anarchy and spotlighted major vulnerabilities in digital infrastructure.</p>

      <div class="title-bar">Operation Aurora</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Operation Aurora was a major cyber-espionage campaign launched in late 2009, believed to originate from China. It targeted U.S. companies including Google, Adobe, and dozens of others. The attackers exploited Internet Explorer vulnerabilities and used advanced persistent threats (APT).</p>
        <p>This was one of the first high-profile cases of suspected state-sponsored cyberattacks, which raised concerns about national security, intellectual property theft, and the increasing sophistication of global cyber warfare.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Anonymous rose to prominence in the 2010s as a decentralized group of online activists and pranksters. Famous for their use of the Guy Fawkes mask, they attacked governments, corporations, and even terrorist organizations through DDoS attacks and leaks.</p>
        <p>They operated without a central leadership, making them unpredictable and hard to trace. From targeting the Church of Scientology to supporting Occupy Wall Street, Anonymous proved that the power of the collective can disrupt global systems.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>In late 2013, retail giant Target experienced one of the most infamous data breaches in history. Hackers accessed point-of-sale systems using stolen vendor credentials, compromising credit and debit card information of over 40 million customers.</p>
        <p>The breach caused major financial and reputational damage. It became a wake-up call for corporations around the world, emphasizing the need for better cybersecurity infrastructure and data protection protocols in an increasingly digital economy.</p>
